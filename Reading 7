### 《A Stochastic Model of Human-Machine Interaction for Learning Dialog Strategies》-Levin, Pieraccini and Eckert(2000)
Dialog system
  - Markov Decision Process
    - Sequence decision process: action set (# granularity), state space, strategy. # MDP
    - Dialog session: path from initial state to final state
    - Dialog strategy: a specification of which action to take at each state.
    - Parameters: transition probabilities & cost distributions
  
  - Two assumptions:
    - State(t+1) depends on State(t) and Action(t)
    - Cost(t) depends on State(t) and Action(t)
    
  - Reinforcement: Learn the optimal strategy through interaction instead of static corpus
    - Limitation: requires a large number of dialog sessions for learning
      --> simulated user: a stochastic generative model -> example: ATIS(air travel information system)
  
  
  - Evaluate: objective function
  
### Assumption:
  Markov assumption
  Independence assumption
